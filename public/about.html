<h1>About Me </h1>
<hr>
<p>I am a student currently pursing B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.My passion is to become a software developer in any top level product based companies. I am currently learning web development from scratch and building very simple projects from the things I learning.I believe in the process not on the goals.I make plans and don't worry about if it was finished because i only see if i improved one percent in that.</p>
